<h1> Project: Web App - Python & API </h1>

This project is a web application built with Streamlit that brings you the daily NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD).
Streamlit helps us create the user interface, while an API (think of it as a special connection) fetches the amazing space images from NASA.

Explore the Cosmos with Apod!
